# BubbleSort
Visually illustrates the bubble sort algorithm step-by-step on an array of random integers.

A bubble sort makes multiple passes on an array. Each pass goes as follows:
The algorithm checks each value against the next value. The check being perfromed depends 
on the "direction" of the sort. If the items in the array are being sorted in ascending order, 
the check will be to determine if the first value is greater than the second value. If the
sort is in descending order, the check will be "less than." If the check passes, the items are
swapped. Once a pass is complete, the last item checked in that pass is known to be in its final sorted 
location, so that item will no longer be checked on future passes.
